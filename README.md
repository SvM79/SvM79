# 👋 Hi, I'm Martin

🚀 I'm a self-directed learner focused on cybersecurity, Linux security, automation, and self-hosted solutions. Currently building out my training lab using **Git**, **Docker**, **Synology**, and **VS Code**, with a strong focus on secure and automated infrastructure.

## 🔐 Cybersecurity & Linux Journey

### ✅ Foundations (Completed)
- Linux Admin (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali)
- Networking: Nmap, Wireshark, Netstat
- SSH Security, UFW Firewall, Suricata IDS

### 🧪 Ethical Hacking (90%)
- Kali setup, SUID/GTFOBins, Metasploit
- Web scanning: Nikto, Gobuster, WhatWeb
- Privilege escalation & MITM prep

### 🛡️ Defensive Skills (Next)
- System hardening with **Lynis**, CIS Benchmarks
- Fail2Ban, SSH lockdown, syslog monitoring
- Git-based audit automation

---

## 🧰 Practical Toolset

- **VS Code** + Git (branches, remotes, merges)
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD experiments
- **Docker** on **Synology DS224+**: Matrix-Synapse self-hosted instance
- **Bare Git Repos** on NAS, synced with WSL
- **Ansible**, **Terraform** (beginner level)

---

## 📦 Recent Projects

- 🧠 [`SvM79/lynis-custom-audits`](https://github.com/SvM79/lynis-custom-audits): Hardening wrapper for CISOfy Lynis
- 🐳 Self-hosted Matrix Synapse: container deployment via Git + Synology
- 🛠️ Git + Synology integration with automated config syncing via WSL

---

## 🎯 Goals & What's Next

- Automate deployment via post-receive Git hook
- Harden container security and explore HTTPS reverse proxies
- Advance Git workflows: branching, patching, security-first releases
- Practice CI/CD pipelines with **Flask**, **GitHub**, **Render**

---

## 🏗️ Learning & Documentation

- 🗃️ Notes structured with **Obsidian** and Git versioning
- 💾 Backup, automation, and logs managed via **Synology**
- 📖 Studying: CompTIA Security+, Network+, ISO 27001, LPI Linux
